        <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
        <p>My name is Steve Dobbs and I live in Columbia, South Carolina.
            Columbia is located in the Eastern Time zone two hours ahead of Mountain time.
            Tuesday evenings I serve as a Temple Worker in the Columbia, Temple. My wife and I teach
            our Ward's youth Sunday School class, which we greatly enjoy. We also served 18 months as
            missionaries for the Pathways Program.</p>
        <p>I am taking classes for an Applied Technology Degree with an emphasis on programming
            and software development. I'm 62 years old and work full time for a contract manufacturer
            of electronic and electromechanical assemblies. I develop test equipment to ensure the
            electronic assemblies' we manufacture, perform their functions correctly, before being
            shipped to the end customer.</p>
        <p>I am proficient in C and have written code in C++, Python, Java and some SQL. I have
            limited experience in HTML, CSS and PHP. I love learning about new technologies and new
            programming languages. I look forward to our class this semester. Take care and good bye
            for now!</p>
