      <h4>Herbs</h4>
      <p>In general, herbs are a widely distributed and widespread group of plants with savory or aromatic properties that are used for flavoring and garnishing food, for medicinal purposes, or for fragrances. The term “herb” refers to the leafy, flowering or root parts of a plant. Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that, like spices, they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food. Some herbs can be infused in boiling water to make herbal teas. Typically, the leaves, either fresh or dried, flowers or seeds are used. Herbal teas tend to be made from aromatic herbs. Common examples include chamomile tea or peppermint tea, which are often used as a source of relaxation. Herbs were used in prehistoric medicine. As far back as 5000 BCE, evidence that Sumerians used herbs in medicine was inscribed on cuneiform. Herbs have long been used as the basis of traditional Chinese herbal medicine, with usage dating as far back as the first century CE. Modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, some drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards.

      <h3>Materia Medica</h3>
      <h4>Chamomile</h4>
      <p>
        Scientific Name: Chamaemelum nobile, Matricaria recutita
Common Name(s): German Chamomile, Garden Chamomile -  also spelled “chamomile” - either spelling is correct (Chamomile in greek means “ground apple”) 
Note: There are two different Chamomile plants. 
•	One is Matricaria recutita (known as German Chamomile, wild chamomile, sweet false chamomile, or mayweed - and often mistakenly called Matricaria chamomilla - a tall, erect annual reaching a height of 2 to 3 feet. 
•	Chamaemelum nobile, formerly named Anthemis nobilis and often called Roman Chamomile, is a perennial that seldom grows more than 9 inches high; this chamomile normally carries a stronger fragrance than its German counterpart. 
Family: Asteraceae
Location: Both chamomiles are native to Europe, Africa, and Asia; naturalized in North America. Both widely cultivated. 
Growing conditions: C. Nobile: Plant hariness zones 3-4. Soil pH 7.0. Full sun to partial shade. M. recutita: Soil pH 6.7. Sandy, well-drained soil. Full sun to partial shade. 
Description:
•	Flowers: Remarkably like daisies; fresh apple scent. C. nobile: solid, solitary central disk, deep yellow color; rays silver-white to cream color; appear at the end of downy stems often in pairs. M. recutita: Hollow, solitary central disk, deep yellow color; appear at the end of downy stems; less fragrant than C. nobile. 
•	Leaves: Alternate, divided into threadlike segments that give featherlike appearance; covered with downy fuzz. J. recutita a bit coarser than C. nobile. 
•	Fruit: M. recutita: five ribbed achene. C. nobile: three-angled achene
•	Height: C. nobile: To 9 inches. M. recutita: 2-3 feet
•	Flowering: Late spring through late summer
Uses: Main uses: Medical Insomnia, anxiety, digestive problems of nervous origin. 
Medicinal: The secret to the chamomiles' medicinal wizardry lies in a volatile oil derived from the flowers. Extracts of the plant or the oil itself have three primary uses: as anti-inflammatories for various afflictions of the skin and mucous membranes; as antispasmodics for treating aliments like indigestion and menstrual cramps; and as anti-infectives for numerous minor illnesses. Ointments, lotions, vapor baths, inhalations, and the like can also be made with chamomile extract.  
Energetics:  Bitter, spicy, slightly warming
Actions: Anti-spasmodic, carminative, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiseptic, vulnerary, aromatic, bitter, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, nervine, sedative, tonic
Parts Used: Flowers and Leaves
Constituents: Volatile oil which includes chamazulene and isadol; mucilage, coumarin, flavone glycosides. 
Preparation and Dosage:
Infusion: Pour a cup of boiling water onto 2 teaspoonfuls of the dried leaves and let infuse for 5-10 minutes. For digestive problems, this tea should be drunk after meals. A stronger infusion should be used as a mouthwash for conditions such as gingivitis. Half a cup of flowers boiled in 2L/4PT of water make a steam bath. Cover your head with a towel and inhale the steam. 
Tincture: Take 2-4ML of the Tincture three times a day 
Notes: Chamomile is renowned for its medical and household uses. Both Garden Chamomile and German Chamomile (Matricaria recutita) can be used. It is an excellent, gentle sedative, safe for use with children. It will contribute to relaxing actions in any combination and is thus used in anxiety and insomnia. Indigestion and inflammations such as gastritis are often eased with Chamomile. It can be used as a mouthwash for mouth inflammations, a gargle for sore throats and an eye-bath for sore eyes. As an inhalation over a steam bath, it will speed recovery from nasal catarrh. Externally it will speed wound healing and reduce swelling. As a carminative with relaxing properties, it will ease flatulence and dyspeptic pain. 
Harvesting: The flowers should be gathered between late spring and late summer when they are not wet with dew or rain. They should be dried with care at not too high a temperature. Harvest the flowers for drying when the petals begin to turn back on the disk. 
Contraindications: 
Caution: Because the flowers contain pollen, tea made from either type of plant may cause contact dermatitis or other allergic reactions. People who have known sensitivities to ragweed, chrysanthemums, or other members of the Compositae family should be cautious about drinking the tea. Large doses can cause vomiting.

      <h4>Responsible Suppliers</h4>
      <p>
We recommend suppliers who provide herbs from growers which preserve wild places and promote organic agriculture. Suppliers should ensure plant species are harvested in a sustainable and legal manner. Suppliers should practice farming techniques which minimize ecological impact.  Suppliers should encourage growers to set aside habitat for native pollinators. Growers and suppliers should be good stewards of nature's bounty. Wild harvested products should be sustainably sourced to prevent overharvesting which can lead to plant extinction. As of 2020 there were 65 plant extinctions recorded in the North American continent.  Many were due to plant habitat loss.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppliers should promote rigorous quality control procedures to ensure identity, purity and potency. Harvested herbs should be stored in climate-controlled facilities, out of direct sunlight, to maintain material quality.
