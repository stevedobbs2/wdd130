        <p>In general, herbs are a widely distributed and widespread group of plants with savory or aromatic properties
          that are used for flavoring and garnishing food, for medicinal purposes, or for fragrances. The term “herb”
          refers to the leafy, flowering or root parts of a plant.<img class="home-img" id="home-img1"
            src="https://cdn.glitch.global/1d006632-9229-4141-b584-bfb8752c94c4/rsz_12.png?v=1654980070230" alt="herbs in dish" /> Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that,
          like spices, they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food. Some herbs can
          be infused in boiling water to make herbal teas. Typically, the leaves, either fresh or dried, flowers or
          seeds are used. Herbal teas tend to be made from aromatic herbs. Common examples include chamomile tea or
          peppermint tea, which are often used as a source of relaxation. Herbs were used in prehistoric medicine. As
          far back as 5000 BCE, evidence that Sumerians used herbs in medicine was inscribed on cuneiform. Herbs have
          long been used as the basis of traditional Chinese herbal medicine, with usage dating as far back as the first
          century CE. Modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, some drugs
          are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical
          standards.</p>
